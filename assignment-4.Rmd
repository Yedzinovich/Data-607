library(knitr)

url <- "https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Yedzinovich/Data-607/main/assignment-4.csv"
flights <- read_csv(url, show_col_types = FALSE)

kable(flights)

flights_long <- flights %>%
  pivot_longer(cols = starts_with("Los Angeles"):starts_with("Seattle"), names_to = "City", values_to = "Flights")

flights_summary <- flights_final_transformation %>%
  mutate(Delay = as.numeric(Delay)) %>%
  group_by(Airline) %>%
  summarize(Total_Delays = sum(Delay, na.rm = TRUE), Total_On_Time = sum(`On Time`, na.rm = TRUE)) %>%
  mutate(Total_Flights = Total_Delays + Total_On_Time,
         Delay_Percentage = (Total_Delays / Total_Flights) * 100,
         On_Time_Percentage = (Total_On_Time / Total_Flights) * 100)
print(flights_summary)
kable(flights_summary)

```

#### Conclusion 
 - AM West has a higher total number of flights and a slightly better on-time performance compared to Alaska.
 - Alaska has a higher percentage of delays compared to AM West.
